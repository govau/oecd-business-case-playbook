<p>Australia has coordinated and prepared the Playbook on behalf of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/digital-government/Organisation">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</a>.</p><p>
The Playbook is based on the experience of Australia, and other OECD members, including Canada, Denmark, Estonia, and the United Kingdom. It builds upon previous work, including the report from the OECD Thematic Group on Business Cases presented by Denmark at the E‑Leaders Meeting in October 2018.</p>

<p>The Playbook covers the foundational concepts of a business case required to present a compelling argument for a digital or ICT investment. Each Play explores a core component of business case development, supported by helpful links.</p>
