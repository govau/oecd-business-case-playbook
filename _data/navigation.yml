# This file generates the navigation across all pages so you don't have to edit every page each time you add a new link. 
# It also helps automate things like setting an active class on the current navigation item.
# To add a new link, just copy the existing pattern. For pages with subpages, take note of the Plays example and copy that.
# IMPORTANT Make sure to keep the exact same formatting with colons, spaces, dashes etc.
