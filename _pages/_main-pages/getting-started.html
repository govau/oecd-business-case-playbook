<p>All governments seek to optimise the success of their investment in digital transformation and ICT infrastructure.</p>
<p>A business case is a formal framework for explaining the need for initiating a program or project as well as practical options to solve the identified problems.</p>
<p>The business case explains to decision makers the purpose, risks, and intent of a proposed ICT investment. It should give the decision-makers confidence that the recommended solution has undergone rigorous analysis and that it is the best option to achieve your objectives and intended outcomes</p>
<p>Business cases should be a mandatory tool in managing digital and ICT initiatives.</p>
<p>The OECD notes the importance to public sector transformation of developing clear business cases to sustain the funding and focused implementation of digital technologies projects.</p>
<p>Many projects struggle to deliver on cost targets, deadlines, and expected benefits. Using a business case provides a basis for planning and implementation. It is a basis for measuring the ongoing viability of the government's investment in a digital service or ICT system.</p>
<p>A compelling business case adequately captures both the business need and how the proposed investment meets that need.</p>
<p>Business cases are evaluated to ensure:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the investment has value, importance, and relevance</li>
    <li>the implementation will be properly managed</li>
    <li>the organisation has the capability to deliver the benefits</li>
    <li>the organisation's resources are working on the highest value opportunities</li>
    <li>initiatives with inter-dependencies are undertaken in the optimum sequence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not all business cases are the same.</h2>
<p>The level of detail, complexity of analysis and even the size of the document should be proportionate to the cost, complexity and scale of the proposal being considered.</p>
<p>The Business Case may be the entire argument presented to decision-makers, it may be part of a suite of documents, or it may inform the documents that decision-makers use to agree to the investment.</p>
<p>Remember that your organisation may have specific requirements on the format of the business case, depending on the size of the investment and the implementation risks of your proposal.</p>
<h2>All good business cases share common qualities</h2>
<p>The structure and content of your document will be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear &ndash; it is easy to understand and logically structured.</li>
    <li>Succint &ndash; it will reflect quality not quantity</li>
    <li>Persuasive &ndash; it presents a compelling argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>The business case will focus on achieving clear and measurable outcomes. It will consider realistic and feasible options and address how you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manage changes to business process and policy</li>
    <li>Develop, acquire and use technology</li>
    <li>Ensure that your people have the skills, knowledge and culture to implement and use the solution</li>
    <li>Develop, use and store data and information.</li>
</ul>

            A business case for a project should...include a statement of the project's objectives and should present clear concise and compelling reasons to the decision makerto support funding for the project.
