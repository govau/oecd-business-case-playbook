<h2>About E-Leaders</h2>
<p>
    Since 2008, the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/digital-government/">OECD Working Party of Senior Digital Government Officials</a> (E-Leaders) has convened to discuss the opportunities, challenges and priorities surrounding the digital transformation of the public sector. The E-Leaders brings together senior digital government decision makers to discuss and reflect on how to better address the digital transformation in the public sector and create smarter, inclusive, productive, more innovative, and responsive governments.</p>
<p>
    The E-Leaders Working Party holds an annual meeting to discuss relevant topics on digital government, data-driven public sector, open government data and service design and delivery. As part of the E-Leaders Working Party, and in order to foster peer learning and sharing of best practices, several Thematic Groups are organised each year. These Groups provide spaces for exchanging practical implementation and identify common challenges across Member and participant countries.</p>
<p>In the context of the E-Leaders Thematic Groups, the Government of Australia has coordinated and prepared this Business Case Playbook. The Playbook aims to provide actionable and practical guidance to articulate the value proposition for coherent digital, technology and data projects across the public sector, as established in the OECD Recommendation on Digital Government Strategies.</p>
