<p>Developing a business case is not a linear process. You will need to refer to each Play at multiple points as you draft and refine your business case.</p>
<p>Each Play consists of four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>description</strong> of the purpose and key steps in the Play.</li>
<li>A description of the <strong>key activities</strong> for the Play.</li>
<li><strong>Questions</strong> to help you consider the issues.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> to further information and resources, such as examples of how other countries tackle the components of the Play.</li>
</ul>
