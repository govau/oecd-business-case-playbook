                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>The Govpass Digital Identity business case sought approval to build a platform that would provide users with a single point of access to a variety of government services, and a single, trusted digital identity called the ‘myGovID’ to access this network. The digital identity and the network of government services to be accessed would be supported by a trusted digital identity framework. The digital identity for Australian citizens would be opt in, and would be verified by Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth providers, eg banks, State governments and other trusted providers. It aimed to give Australians more choice in how they interact with government, including the option to avoid using a shopfront.</p>
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>This section will be a way to highlight the results of the business case, in terms of how the project or program's implementation benefitted from particular elements and features of the business case. It is not meant to be a list of outcomes from the project or program itself.</p>
                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>The business case was developed amongst a complex environment. Such a major transformation for accessible online government services meant that policy and ICT business areas were required to work closely together throughout. The completion of this initiative was integral to Australia working towards Digital Government by 2025 – as announced by the Government.</p>
                <p>The key elements of this successful business case were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding the needs of the user and using this as a reason for change </li>
                    <li>Engage early and often with government decision-makers and stakeholders</li>
                    <li>Seek input and active engagement from government agencies </li>
                    <li>Facilitate workshops with stakeholders to determine lifecycle costs, benefits and risks </li>
                    <li>Analyse a range of technical solutions </li>
                    <li>Altering costings as the outcomes evolved over time</li>
                    <li>Establishing costing methodology for agile project</li>
                    <li>As a whole-of-government proposal, adopting an ‘open conversation’ policy was key to managing stakeholder expectations and requests</li>
