            <p class="lead">Build and refine your plan</p>
            <p>Traditional approaches begin with a plan and seldom return to it as work progresses. A good plan should evolve throughout the business case process to account for new information and desired outcomes. To form your plan, think about what you are trying to achieve, who you will need to help and when it needs to be finished.</p>

                <p><strong>Understand the 'what'</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure you understand your business and have an idea of the key problems your business case is trying to address (Refer to <a href="../play0/index.html">Play 0</a>). This will help inform who needs to be involved, your timelines, and how you might approach developing the business case.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Understand the 'who'</strong></p>
                <p>Set up a multi-disciplinary team and identify who can provide input into the business case. Teams with a diversity of skills and knowledge should work together throughout the lifecycle of the business case to ensure each stage benefits from different perspectives. You should also know who your stakeholders are. Business cases require support from inside and outside of your organisation, and you should seek this input regularly.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Understand the 'when'</strong></p>
                <p>Plan for the relevant dates and work backwards to ensure you have the right review points in place. Your government or organisation may have set dates for business case approvals. Much of your work should be possible in parallel, but be aware of any timing that depends on other components.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Understand the 'how'</strong></p>
                <p>Find out if your organisation or government has an established process to assess and approve business cases. This can vary depending on the size and complexity of the business case. For example, the Australian Government requires a two-stage review process to create confidence that they are choosing the best option for a digital or ICT investment.</p>
