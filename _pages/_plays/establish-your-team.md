<p>Pull together a multidisciplinary team of the right people to develop the business case.</p>
<p>Traditionally, organisations have divided capabilities across functional areas. In contrast, a multidisciplinary team draws members from a range of disciplines.</p>
<p>People with expert skills will need to join your team to help manage specific components, such as costings or risk assessments. The team could expand to include people from complementary agencies or external contractors for intense bursts of effort.</p>

<h4>Identify the skills you need</h4>
<p>An effective multidisciplinary team is built on a diverse mix of skills&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Consider the type of skills you need to help you develop the business case. You may require generalist policy advisers, as well as subject matter specialists, business architects, or content designers. The people who you expect will implement or deliver the solution should also be involved.</p>
<p>Teams with a diversity of skills and knowledge should work together throughout the lifecycle of the business case to ensure each stage benefits from different perspectives.</p>
<h4>Carry out a stocktake of in-house skills and identify any gaps</h4>
<p>Identify who has the necessary experience in this work and establish their availability to contribute.</p>
<p>Consider whether you need to engage external specialists with specific skills such as costing, procurement, risk management or expertise with particular technologies.</p>
<h4>Consider the advantages of working across government</h4>
<p>Consider whether you will need to collaborate and work with other organisations or agencies within your government.</p>
<p>Determine how the team will work and whether it needs to be physically co-located.</p>
<h4>Establish the team</h4>
<p>Set up your multi-disciplinary team and establish your processes and practices for working together.</p>
<p>Agree how the team will manage their work and maintain relationships.</p>
<p>You should establish regular work practices and cadence, such as daily stand up meetings, and sprints of work and retrospectives.</p>
<p>Consider how the team members maintain relationships with the usual work areas while participating in the multidisciplinary team.</p>
