<p>Identify potential solutions that could address the business problem. There are many methods you can use for developing options, such as brainstorming or scenario planning. You might conduct a design sprint or hackathon to quickly prototype potential solutions. Each option needs to be viable and achievable, and meaningfully different from the other options you might be presenting. It is unhelpful to propose options that you cannot practically implement&mdash; due to limitations in your organisation or in your country&rsquo;s strategic context, such as funding constraints or government policy.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand and can describe the current service. This is your baseline. It provides the basis from which you can measure the advantages, disadvantages, and costs of other options you consider. It is also your &lsquo;No change&rsquo; option.</p>

<h3>Define your baseline</h3>
<p>This is&nbsp;the &lsquo;No Change&rsquo; option. It provides the basis from which you can measure the advantages, disadvantages, and costs of other options. It may be that the most sensible solution, at least for the time being, is not to make a major change.</p>
<h3>Identify feasible options</h3>
<p>Try to identify all the options that could achieve the desired outcomes in the current context. Consider any constraints, such as policy or technology, that might limit what options are practically feasible and achievable.</p>
<p>Hold workshops where stakeholders can collaborate to solve problems and share perspectives. You might like to think about options in terms of changes to people, process and technology.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Analyse and compare each option</h3>
<p>Establish the criteria against which you will evaluate the options. These should suit the needs of your organisation and government. Your analysis should include a comparison of costs, benefits and risks as a minimum. Refer to <a href="/plays/define-options/">Define options</a> for further detail.</p>
<h3>Align options to outcomes</h3>
<p>Assess each option against the desired outcomes to identify strengths and weaknesses. It is important to note that different options may deliver different measurable benefits against the proposed outcomes.</p>
