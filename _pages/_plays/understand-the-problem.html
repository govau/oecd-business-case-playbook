<p>Identify the key potential solutions that could address the business problem. Each option needs to be viable and achievable. There is no point in proposing options that you cannot implement in your organisation or the current context, perhaps due to your governmentâ€™s funding policies. Explore viable options in detail and assess how they will achieve the desired outcomes. Remember, 'Nothing is as expensive as building the wrong thing'.</p>

<p>Outline the problem the business case seeks to resolve. You should fill gaps in your knowledge as they appear and identify factors that impact the problem. Think about how the problem relates to your current environment, and how it sits within a broader context. It is important to analyse the problem against the backdrop of your organisation and your government's priorities.</p>
<p>Understand how the business problem interacts with user needs and experience. You should keep users at the centre of your solution design. Conduct user research to identify existing pain points. Users offer great insights for designing effective options. You can use surveys and interviews to catalogue user expectations and inform your business case options. User research and engagement should happen throughout the development of the business case.</p>
<p>You need to retest your understanding of the users experience as you develop and consider different solutions to the business problem.</p>
<p>Define the outcomes which will resolve your business problem. The future state will need to deliver on these outcomes by changing your organisation's culture, processes, business models and technologies.</p>
<p>Once you understand the problems you are trying to solve, you need to understand what solving those problems could look like. What is your vision for users of your service? What would a day in the life of your organisation's employees look like?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your understanding of the future state design will evolve as you develop and refine your options.</p>
<p>You want your reader to understand why this problem deserves attention.</p>

<h3>Understand user needs and the reason for change</h3>
<p>Conduct research into the people who interact with your service or product, and why the current state is not working. Summarise why the change is required and how an investment in technology, processes and people could support this change.</p>
<h3>Put the problem in context</h3>
<p>Identify how the business problem came about and what factors impact the problem. This will help you understand the potential complexity of the problem. You also need to identify the priorities for your organisation. Think about how resolving the business problem might align with these priorities.</p>
<h3>Define the future experience</h3>
<p>There are various ways you can create a positive experience for your users. Think about how you can change functions across your organisation to meet the needs of the user. This includes functions relating to people, processes and technology.</p>
<p>Understand and identify what evidence and data would be available for you to measure the change.</p>
<h3>Design with the user at the centre</h3>
<p>Design the future state with the user in mind. The business case should identify who are the users and what they need. Engage with the people who will be using the service.</p>
<h3>Explain 'why now'</h3>
<p>Describe why the problem needs to be addressed now, and not later. Help the decision-maker understand why this is a priority and what will happen if the current situation continues. A clear description of the current situation will form an important part of the 'No Change' option</p>
