<p>Understand what you will need to do and how long it is likely to take.</p>
<p>Work backwards from milestone dates you need to meet. Be aware of any timing or requirements that is specific to your organisation. Ensure you set up review points, and allocate realistic time for feedback, including from external stakeholders. Establishing milestones is a good way to mark the progress of your business case.</p>
<p>Milestones are also helpful for identifying elements that depend on other business case components.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the ‘when’</strong></p>
<p>Plan for the relevant dates and work backwards to ensure you have the right review points in place. Your government or organisation may have set dates for business case approvals. Much of your work should be possible in parallel, but be aware of any timing that depends on other components.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Understand the ‘how’</strong></p>
<p>Find out if your organisation or government has an established process to assess and approve business cases. This can vary depending on the size and complexity of the business case. For example, the Australian Government requires a two-stage review process to create confidence that they are choosing the best option for a digital or ICT investment.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Know the objectives of your organisation</strong></p>
<p>Your business case must align to the objectives of your organisation. Define the objectives clearly and describe how your plan will incorporate them into your approach and outcomes. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>Know the priorities of your government</strong></p>
<p>Identify relevant policies and priorities (especially those relating to digital transformation and the government’s use of digital and ICT). Align your options and implementation approach to the priorities to strengthen your business case. </p>
