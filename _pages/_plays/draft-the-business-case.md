<p>Your analysis of the preferred option should form the beginnings of a more detailed implementation and risk management plan.</p>

<p>This is the phase where you take the evidence and your experience in considering potential solutions to the business problem and pull it all together as a compelling story.</p>
<p>Explain how your preferred option compares to the other options and highlight the key benefits. Explain why the other options are not preferred.</p>
<p>Make sure that your readers can clearly understand the scope of the business problem you are trying to resolve, and what would be the outcomes of successful change. Your business case should explain how the preferred option delivers on these outcomes and how it aligns to the organisation&rsquo;s and government&rsquo;s policy objectives.</p>
<p>You may need to complete a more detailed analysis of the costs, benefits and implementation approach for your preferred option compared to the other options.</p>
<p>Explain in detail how your organisation would implement the preferred solution. You should demonstrate that your recommended approach to implementation provides the best opportunity for resolving the business problem, and that you have identified the resources needed to manage and support the implementation successfully. This includes establishing fit-for-purpose governance, risk management and assurance arrangements. Ideally, you would also flag how you have considered lessons learned from other initiatives.</p>
<p>The implementation approach will vary based on factors such as the complexity of the proposed digital or ICT solution and your government&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>You should consider adopting agile approaches that will increase the likelihood of success and deliver early value to users. For example, developing a Minimum Viable Product that meets user needs, and allows for early learning, delivers value quickly. This approach of iterative and incremental delivery, coupled with continuous learning and improvement, gives you confidence that the solution adapts and responds to evolving user needs over time.</p>

<h4>Break up the work into manageable pieces</h4>
<p>Choose the appropriate delivery method for the project (e.g. agile, waterfall or blended). For a delivery method like agile, your plan will need to explain how you will incorporate and adapt to changes in the specifications. Plan out the key milestones and how and when they will be achieved. You will also need to consider how risks and dependencies will be managed. For example, the completion of related projects.</p>
<h4>Determine the organisational capacity and capability</h4>
<p>Determine the existing skills of your workforce and their availability to participate when needed. Plan what and when key skills are required. Plan for training requirements.</p>
<h4>Factor in technology procurement</h4>
<p>Determine how you will source your technology capabilities. This can be complex depending on your government and legal requirements. Working with suppliers external to your organisation is a large undertaking. Speak with the relevant people in your organisation to ensure you include references to the appropriate policies.</p>
<h4>Set up governance frameworks to manage risk</h4>
<p>Identify who will be responsible for how key decisions will be made and how issues will be resolved. You may have already identified who these people are as part of setting up governance for decisions related to the business case. Refer to <a href="https://businesscaseplaybook.service.gov.au/plays/define-options/">Define options</a> for more detail on managing risks.</p>
<h4>Define and measure success</h4>
<p>Define measurement criteria which will be used to determine the success of the project. Establish checkpoints to ensure the project is on track to deliver the agreed outcomes. This will provide confidence to the decision-makers that outcomes and benefits will be closely monitored.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Have a plan for change</h4>
<p>A new digital or ICT capability will change processes and people. Develop a plan to prepare and support people to embrace the change. This will include training, communication, and transition activities. This plan will be critical in minimising the risk and disruption associated with the change whilst also helping to achieve outcomes.</p>
